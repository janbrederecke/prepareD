R package with useful functions for data preparation and documentation.

Author and maintainer: Jan Brederecke

## Installation

You can not yet install the released version of prepareD from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("prepareD")
```
because it will probably only be submitted to CRAN in the fall of 2022.

You can nonetheless get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("janbrederecke/prepareD")
```
